# Software Development is Magic

Developers are magicians 
Asking sand to do their bidding 

You speak aloud your desire (or type, or click) and it is made manifest 
The right spell and you house lights up when itâ€™s dark
The right spell and you house cools down when the outside world is hot
The correct spell and money moves accounts and (hopefully) makes you even more money 

These are the spells that magicians have crafted so that non magicians can indirectly ask Sand to grant their desires

The magicians themselves know that you have to be very careful what you wish for
The Sand is a fickle genie 
A mis-cast spell can have consequences 

We call objects into being by calling them by a name
Give them inheritance, properties and bilities 

But like the Sorcerer's Apprentice, we can create magic beyond our ability to control. 

A little humility 
And an understanding that our spells can have consequences 
Is what separates a true wizard from an acolyte 

Remember to be careful what you wish for
