We live in a probabilistic universe, with the obvious  exception of death. Even taxes are probability weighted. 


There is no absolute certainty in markets or anything else in life.  The outputs of all our calculations should be expressed in terms of percentages. 
Chance rules all. Risk is not just built into the system, it *IS* the system.
